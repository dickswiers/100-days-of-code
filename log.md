# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2020-10-07

**Today's Progress**: Definitely more than an hour of Python studied at sololearn.com. Exceptions & Files completed with Module 4 Quiz. 

**Thoughts:** The penny is starting to drop a little. And then suddenly it doesn't.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
